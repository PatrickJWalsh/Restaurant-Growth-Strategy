# Restaurant Growth Strategy
I was in contact with a small business (restaurant) in Binghamton, and we agreed to a pro-bono engagement aimed to increase margins and help grow the business.


## Project Scope
I was engaged with a local restaurant in the Binghamton area, and we set out to accomplish the following:

- Identify sales trends and ways to increase margins (with menu mix being a point of emphasis)
- Look at Labor allocation to see if reasonable reduction can be made
- Drive further engagement within the community as well as for franchising opportunities
  - One of the owner’s goals was to open a restaurant location on Binghamton’s campus.  By driving increased engagement with students, this would generate the necessary interest to pitch the business opportunity to the governing organization
