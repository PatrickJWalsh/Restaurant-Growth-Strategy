# Restaurant Growth Strategy
I was in contact with a small business (restaurant) in Binghamton, and we agreed to a pro-bono engagement aimed to increase margins and help grow the business.


## Project Scope
I was engaged with a local restaurant in the Binghamton area, and we set out to accomplish the following:

- **Identify sales trends and ways to increase margins (with menu mix being a point of emphasis)**
- **Look at Labor allocation to see if reasonable reduction can be made**
- **Drive further engagement within the community and compile prospects franchising opportunities**
  - One of the owner’s goals was to open a restaurant location on Binghamton’s campus.  By driving increased engagement with students, this would generate the necessary interest to pitch the business opportunity to the governing organization

## Collaboration & Personnel Involved
My friend and I completed this as a two-person team and met periodically with the restaurant owner to:

- Gain alignment on project scope 
- Learn how to use PoS system to pull data 
- Report findings / deliver recommendation

## Project Highlights

- **Analyzed 24 months of sales data and determined appropriate actions to grow business: **
  - Sales channel (in-person vs. takeout vs. delivery) has become increasingly reliant on delivery – improvements to menu layout and promos on delivery platforms can increase margins
  - Sales volume by day and hour – business shifted during covid away from almost exclusively late night and weekend business to more balanced throughout the week with a new peak emerging around dinner time – working with student groups and offering promos during this time window will increase top-line (catering for campus events in the evening on weekdays)
  - Menu Item performance – Determined which items can be cut from the menu to reduce COGs and to allow flexibility with inventory, and identified most profitable items which can be further incentivized through promos
- **Analyzed Labor data (employee shifts) to determine that there is room for reduction with respect to business volume during non-peak hours**
- **Created contact list of >200 student groups (~15k students) and > 50 business / entrepreneurial groups within the tri-state area **
  - Shortlisted student groups to target groups with highest ROI (based on member count and meeting frequency)
  - Compiled contact info for business / entrepreneurial groups, professional development centers, and school alumni associations given the business' customer base (primarily college students)
